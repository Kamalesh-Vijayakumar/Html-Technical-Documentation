        <h1>What is Python?</h1><br>
        <p>
          Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming
          language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data
          structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it
          very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use
          as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
          together.Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability
          and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.Python supports
          modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code
          reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are
          available in source or binary form without charge for all major
          platforms, and can be freely distributed. <br>
          <br>
          Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. 
          Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. 
          Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. 
          Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception.
           When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. 
           A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary
            expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. 
            The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power.
             On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source:
              the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

        <h1 >Datatypes in Python</h1>
        <br><p>
          Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It
          represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be
          performed on a particular data.Since everything is an object in Python
          programming, data types are classes and variables are instances
          (objects) of these classes. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:</h4> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Numeric</li>
                <li>Sequence Type</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Set</li>
                <li>Dictionary</li>
                <li>Binary Types</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <h4>Numeric Data Type:</h4><br>
            The numeric data type in Python represents the data that has a numeric value. A numeric value can be an integer, 
            a floating number, or even a complex number.These values are defined as Python int, Python float, and Python
            complex classes in Python.Integers – This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative 
            whole numbers (without fractions or decimals). In Python, there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.
            Float – This value is represented by the float class. It is a real number with a floating-point representation.
            It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be
            appended to specify scientific notation.Complex Numbers – A complex number is represented by a complex class. 
            It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. <br>
              <br>
          <h4>Sequence Data Type:</h4>
          The sequence Data Type in Python is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. 
          Sequences allow storing of multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence types in Python.<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python String</li>
            <li>
              Python List

            </li>
            <li>
              Python Tuple

            </li>
          </ul><br><br>
            <h4>Boolean Data Type :</h4> <br>
            Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. 
            Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). 
            However non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in a Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false. 
            It is denoted by the class bool. Note – True and False with capital ‘T’ and ‘F’ are valid booleans otherwise python will throw an error. <br><br>
            Example: <br>
             The first two lines will print the type of the boolean values True and False, which is <class ‘bool’>. The third line will cause an error, because true is not a valid keyword in Python. Python is case-sensitive, which means it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. You need to capitalize the first letter of true to make it a boolean value.

        <p>Numbers don’t lie and if they are to be believed then Python is the most preferred programming language for data scientists across the world. 
          However, what makes the use of Python so apt for data science? Why is the use of Python so predominant across the globe?  
          For any data scientist – aspiring or existent – using Python for data science and data analytics is one of the best bets. 
          This general-purpose programming language can help in the development of both web and desktop applications. 
          It also aids in the development of complex numeric and scientific applications. <br>
          <br>
          Python is extremely popular in the programming world for two reasons: it can handle
           a humongous range of tasks and second, the language is extremely beginner friendly.
           Just to give you an example of its beginner friendliness, English words are used in the syntax
            of Python code which means anyone can understand it and get started. 
          Let us now move on to understanding the use of Python as a programming language.
